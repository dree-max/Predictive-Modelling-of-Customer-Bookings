# Predictive Modelling of Customer Bookings

A machine learning project focused on predicting customer booking behavior using advanced data analytics and predictive modeling techniques.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a complete predictive modeling solution designed to forecast customer booking patterns and understand the key factors that influence booking decisions. The project leverages statistical analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

## Business Problem

Understanding customer booking behavior is critical for optimizing revenue, managing capacity, and improving customer experience. This project addresses the challenge of predicting which customers are likely to complete bookings based on historical data and customer characteristics.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Predictive Modeling**: Implementation of machine learning algorithms to forecast booking probability
- **Feature Engineering**: Comprehensive analysis and transformation of booking-related variables
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Statistical analysis revealing critical factors affecting customer decisions
- **Performance Evaluation**: Rigorous model validation using industry-standard metrics

## Model Performance

The current predictive model achieves the following metrics:

| Metric    | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Precision | 0.80  |
| Recall    | 0.006 |

**Key Findings:**
- **Primary Predictor**: `purchase_lead` (time between purchase and departure) emerges as the most influential variable
- **Flight Characteristics**: Flight duration and timing significantly impact booking probability
- **Geographic Factors**: Booking origin shows minimal predictive power

4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Grid search and cross-validation for optimal performance
5. **Model Validation**: Robust evaluation using holdout and cross-validation techniques

## Results and Insights

### Primary Insights

- **Purchase Timing**: The time between purchase and departure date is the strongest predictor of booking completion
- **Flight Attributes**: Duration and scheduling significantly influence customer decisions
- **Geographic Independence**: Booking location has minimal impact on completion probability

### Business Implications

- **Revenue Optimization**: Focus on customers with optimal purchase lead times
- **Capacity Planning**: Leverage flight characteristic insights for better scheduling
